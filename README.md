# satsusl

## Introduction

Satsu SL is a simple scripting language. This repository contains three tools,
`libsatsu`, `csatsu`, and `gsatsu`. The `libsatsu` library provides a C/C++
interface for interpreting and managing Satsu SL programs. The `csatsu` tool
provides a CLI for doing the same, built upon `libsatsu`. The `gstatsu` tool
provides a GUI for doing the same, built upon `libsatsu`.

## Dependencies

## Management

## Usage

Satsu SL can either be used as a library in C/C++ programs with `libsatsu`, or
you can run `csatsu` / `gsatsu` to open a simple GUI to manage and run Satsu SL
programs.
